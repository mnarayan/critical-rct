Philosophers of mind such as Evan Thompsom argue why science cannot ignore human experience. [Essay](https://aeon.co/essays/the-blind-spot-of-science-is-the-neglect-of-lived-experience) and [book](https://www.amazon.com/Blind-Spot-Science-Cannot-Experience-ebook/dp/B0C76Z6SNM)

> Since the dawn of the Enlightenment, humanity has looked to science to tell us who we are, where we come from, and where we’re going, but we’ve gotten stuck thinking we can know the universe from outside our position in it. When we try to understand reality only through external physical things imagined from this outside position, we lose sight of the necessity of experience. This is the Blind Spot, which the authors show lies behind our scientific conundrums about time and the origin of the universe, quantum physics, life, AI and the mind, consciousness, and Earth as a planetary system. The authors propose an alternative vision: scientific knowledge is a self-correcting narrative made from the world and our experience of it evolving together. To finally “see” the Blind Spot is to awaken from a delusion of absolute knowledge and to see how reality and experience intertwine.

What would a scientific/rigorous way of incorporating human experience look like?
