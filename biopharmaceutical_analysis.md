Stifel analysts on real world evidence at JPM

> A real world evidence paradigm shift is coming… Eventually. AI has made it possible to use synthetic data to replace the placebo arm in
drug trials, something that is increasingly necessary, as the drugs with accelerated approvals struggle to recruit for post-market studies
and maintain the integrity of their placebo groups. As Tracy Hayne from Slipstream IT put it, we shouldn’t be expecting people to voluntarily
put their lives on the line for science, but that’s what we’re asking 50% of people to do when we enrol an RCT of a drug that’s already in the
market. 

This commentary is fascinating insight into perceptions and misconceptions about RCT-grade evidence. 

- People aren't putting their lives on the line by enrolling in the placebo arm of an RCT, especially if there are a lot of unknowns about the drug in practical settings. This pre-supposes that we already somehow 
know exactly what the benefits of the drug really are. So why is this the perception amongst people within biopharma who ought to know better? 
- Second why is there a perception that post-market surveillance pragmatic RCTs would only involve placebo controlled trials? There are many other options. 
- Who exactly is replacing the placebo arm with synthetic data? We simply don't have well validated synthetic controls yet, so where is the evidence? Who understands how to assess this?
