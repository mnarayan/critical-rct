- How to measure effectiveness of blackswans? This topic comes up in a number of different settings
  - Nielsen and Qiu [analysis](https://scienceplusplus.org/trouble_with_rcts/) in the context of evaluating effectiveness of science funding
  - N-of-1 patient stakeholder advocacy about effective treatments
  - The promise and perils of heterogeneity assumption in precision medicine: that there exists some tiny subgroup of patients who actually benefit from treatment if we could only find them.

- Some solutions have been proposed by 
  - Evidential pluralism approach of Russo
  - EBM+ (Evidence based medicine plus)
  - Rani Lill Anjum's recommendation to reconsider [dispositional casual powers](https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/39574) and in [Causal evidence and dispositions in medicine and public health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7142708/)

Counterargument to EBM+ and causal dispositions. 
- The focus on mechanistic evidence has often failed in target based drug discovery and in history of using invalid surrogate endpoints.

  - My counterargument to this paper would be that we never did any severe testing of the mechanistic requirements of aducanumab. So this was a mismatch of the requirement to assess mechanism and employment of extremely weak/invalid measurements in support of it. If we had employed sound causal surrogate endpoint analysis, aducanumab would have been dead a long time ago, along with amyloid plaques as a candidate surrogate endpoint.
